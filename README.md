# Onchain Parkour - Encrypted Gaming DApp

Onchain Parkour is a decentralized parkour game built on the blockchain that leverages **FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine)** by Zama to enable privacy-preserving gameplay. Players can mint character NFTs, play an interactive parkour game where they jump over obstacles to accumulate scores, and submit their encrypted scores to the blockchain. The game utilizes FHEVM's homomorphic encryption capabilities to store and compare player scores in an encrypted state on-chain, allowing for secure leaderboard rankings without revealing actual score values until decryption. This innovative approach ensures player privacy while maintaining competitive gameplay through encrypted score comparisons and a transparent leaderboard system.
